# Enterprise Architecture

Traditional enterprise architecture practises that focus on heavy documentation and lengthy blueprinting are dated and counter to agile principles. This approach provides little value in today's business environment, which requires nimbleness and optimising time to market. Additionally, managing undocumented systems can lead to challenges in extending or maintaining them, creating brittle and complex designs.

Architects need to adopt a **lean** approach to architecting and documenting systems that align with agile delivery methods. Rather than documenting everything at the beginning, the aim is to develop architecture incrementally and continuously to deliver “just enough” architecture to guide organisational transformation. It is crucial to capture all architectural decisions from the start to maintain clarity and intentional design. Architecture documentation should be an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought or a catch-up activity. Automation can be leveraged to maximise efficiency in creating and updating documentation artefacts, ensuring they are current based on what was built and what's running. By following these practises, architects can create well-documented architectures that contribute to the success of projects by ensuring understanding, thoughtful design, and effective communication.

This repository will provide a list of lean enterprise architecture resources.
