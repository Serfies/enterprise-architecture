# Enterprise Architecture Principles

An Enterprise Architecture Principles document is a strategic tool that ensures technology serves the business in the most effective and efficient manner. It guides the organisation's technology initiatives towards desired outcomes.

## **General Principles**
   - Ensure the enterprise architecture is aligned with business strategies, goals, and drivers.
   - Prioritise initiatives based on business value and ROI.
   - Adopt standardised processes, technologies, and architectures wherever possible to reduce complexity.
   - Design systems and processes in a modular manner, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
   - Promote information sharing and integration across the organisation.
   - Keep architectures and processes as simple as possible to facilitate understanding, maintenance, and change management.
   - Incorporate security and privacy considerations into all architectural decisions.
   - Make environmentally responsible and sustainable choices in architectural designs.

## **Technical Principles**
   - Ensure systems and processes are interoperable to facilitate communication and data exchange.
   - Prefer open standards to proprietary ones to avoid vendor lock-in and promote interoperability.
   - Promote reusability of components and services to reduce development time and costs.
   - Design architectures to scale gracefully as demand increases.
   - Ensure systems are resilient to failures and can recover quickly from disruptions.
   - Design systems to be easily maintained and managed.
   - Ensure data accuracy and integrity in all systems and processes.

## **Governance Principles**
   - Establish a clear governance framework to guide architectural decisions and ensure compliance with internal and external standards and regulations.
   - Encourage a culture of continuous improvement in architectural practices.
   - Engage stakeholders in key architectural decisions to ensure alignment and buy-in.
   - Establish metrics for measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the architecture.
   - Ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, and provide for auditing where necessary.
   - Promote training and education to build architectural knowledge and skills across the organization.
   - Establish robust change management processes to handle changes in the architecture.
